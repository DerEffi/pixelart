README

circle.geany

circle.geany is a project file for the Geany IDE. Copy this file to Circle's
root directory and open it with Geany! For the build targets "Make current
directory..." and "Make current file" a file must be open for edit in Geany. For
the menu point "Execute (with bootloader)" see the file doc/eclipse-support.txt!
For the menu point "Write to SD card" you have to define "SDCARD = /mount_path/"
in Config.mk, where mount_path is the directory to which a SD card in your
external SD card reader is mounted in your system. On Raspbian itself this must
not be the path /boot/! Beware not to overwrite system files in /boot/ here!

rpi4.cfg.diff

Diff file for the JTAG configuration for the Raspberry Pi 4, see the file
doc/debug-jtag.txt for info!
