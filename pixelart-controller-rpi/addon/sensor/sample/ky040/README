README

This sample program displays events, generated from a KY-040 rotary encoder
module, on the screen. Furthermore there is a rotor (the left one) in the top
right corner of the screen, which turns with the encoder.

You have to attach the KY-040 module properly to your Raspberry Pi. The sample
program by default uses GPIO13 (chip numbers, not header positions) to connect
the CLK pin (A), GPIO19 to connect the DT (B) pin, and GPIO26 for the SW pin.
This configuration can be changed in the kernel.cpp file before building. Don't
forget to connect GND and + (3.3V power) of the KY-040 module to the respective
Raspberry Pi pins.
