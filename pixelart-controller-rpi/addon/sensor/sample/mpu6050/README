README

This sample program does consecutive acceleration and gyroscope measurements
using the MPU-6050 device and displays the results on the screen.

The MPU-6050 device/module has to be attached properly to the I2C interface of
your Raspberry Pi. Don't forget to connect GND and power (3.3V) to the
respective pins of your Raspberry Pi. The AD0 pin should be connected to GND to
set I2C slave address 0x68.

Please note that the sample program and driver currently does not support
calibration of the MPU-6050. That's why the reported values for acceleration and
gyroscope are normally not zero, if the MPU-6050 device lays on flat ground.
Furthermore the Z-acceleration in this position is 1g (reported value = 16384).
