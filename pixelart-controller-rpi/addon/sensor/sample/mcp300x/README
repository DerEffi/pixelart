README

This sample continuously displays the current input voltage at a channel of a
MCP3004 or MCP3008 DAC using the single-ended conversation method. The
MCP3004/3008 has to be connected to the SPI0 or SPI1 (AUX) masters as follows
(SoC GPIO numbers):

MCP3004/3008	SPI0		SPI1 (AUX)

/CS SHDN	GPIO8		GPIO18		(CE0)
DOUT		GPIO9		GPIO19		(MISO)
DIN		GPIO10		GPIO20		(MOSI)
CLK		GPIO11		GPIO21		(SCLK)
DGND		GND
AGND		GND
VDD		3.3V
VREF		3.3V
CHn		input voltage (0..VREF, n = 0..7)

Before build you may have to change the configuration options in the files
kernel.h (enable the #define USE_SPI_MASTER_AUX to use the SPI1 (AUX) master
instead of SPI0) and kernel.cpp (e.g. CHANNEL and/or VREF). On the Raspberry Pi
4 there are additional SPI master devices, which can be used too. Please see the
file include/circle/spimaster.h for their pinout!

For more information see the MCP3004/3008 datasheet!
