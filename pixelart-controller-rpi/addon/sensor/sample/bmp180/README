README

This sample program does consecutive temperature and barometric pressure
measurements using the BMP180 digital pressure sensor and displays the results
on the screen.

The BMP180 sensor module has to be attached properly to the I2C interface of
your Raspberry Pi. Don't forget to connect GND and power (3.3V) to the
respective pins of your Raspberry Pi.
