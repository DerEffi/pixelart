README

This directory with its subdirectories contains a partial port of the Raspbian
userland accelerated graphics libraries, which implement the following APIs:

* EGL 1.4
* OpenGL ES 1.1 and 2.0
* OpenVG 1.1
* Dispmanx (proprietary)

Please see the following website for detailed information about the first three
APIs:

	https://www.khronos.org/

The main goal has been to offer an opportunity to use 2D and 3D accelerated
graphics applications with Circle. Other APIs, which are implemented by the
userland code, are not supported here, because they are inactive standards and
to reduce the porting effort.

To build all needed accelerated graphics libraries enter the following commands
in this directory:

	./makeall clean
	./makeall

In the addon/vc4/interface/sample/ directory there are some sample programs,
which demonstrate, how to use the referenced APIs. They have been used for
testing too. There is a new project (under construction), which provides a few
additional samples:

	https://github.com/rsta2/libgraphics

The accelerated graphics support is still experimental, because there were only
a few test cases available. It does build with AARCH = 32 only and cannot be
built on Raspbian.

The source code for porting this accelerated graphics support has been taken
from:
