This directory contains the following accelerated graphics sample programs in
the respective subdirectory, which show some accelerated graphics demo:

hello_dispmanx	Shows some squares, demonstrates the Dispmanx API
hello_tiger	Shows a rotating tiger face, demonstrates the OpenVG API
hello_triangle	Shows a rotating cube, demonstrates the OpenGL ES API
hello_triangle2	Shows a fractal image, movable by using an USB mouse,
		demonstrates the OpenGL ES API

Please go to the subdirectory of your choice and enter the following commands to
build the sample. The Circle libraries, the libraries in addon/linux/ and
addon/vc4/vchiq/ and the accelerated graphics libraries in addon/vc4/interface/
have to be built before!
