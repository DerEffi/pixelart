README

This sample demonstrates using the driver for ST7789-based dot-matrix displays.
You have to set your hardware configuration in the file kernel.cpp before build.
The DC_PIN is required, the RESET_PIN and BACKLIGHT_PIN are optional and not
provided by some displays. Please specify the GPIO chip number (not the header
position) here or CST7789Display::None, if the pin is not connected. The default
display connection is as follows:

Display		Raspberry Pi	Comment
			GPIO

SCL	<--	SCLK	11	SPI clock
SDA	<--	MOSI	10	SPI data
CS		not used	Chip select, e.g. GPIO8 (CS0) or GPIO7 (CS1)
DC	<--		22	Data/Command selection
RES	<--		23	Reset
BLK		not used	Backlight, e.g. GPIO24
VCC	<--	3.3V		may be 5V for some displays (be careful!)
GND	<-->	GND

An additional DOUT line is not used, if provided by the display. In the given
configuration the SPI settings CPOL/CPHA are normally 1/0. If a chip select line
is provided by your display, this may change to CPOL/CPHA 0/0. You can try this
out, if the display does not work.

The sample program shows some text on the display and a countdown with progress
bar. After that a rectangle with a cross will be drawn on the display. After 5
seconds the display is switched off and the system reboots.
