README

This sample program demonstrates how to use a HD44780-controlled LCD dot-matrix
display. Before building you have to configure the program in kernel.cpp
according to the hardware of your LCD display. You have to set the display size
(columns, rows) and the GPIO pins to which the different pins of the display
(D4-D7, EN, RS, (RW)) are connected. Please note that the display driver uses
the 4-bit mode. The pins D0-D3 do not need to be connected. Further the RW pin
can be connected to ground on the display, because the driver does not read from
the display.

There are two modes of the demo program. If you start it without an USB keyboard
connected, it will display "No keyboard!" on the LCD display and will count the
time from program start on.

With an USB keyboard connected you can type on it and the typed characters will
be echoed to the LCD display. You may have to set-up your keyboard map first,
using the "keymap=" setting in cmdline.txt (see doc/cmdline.txt) to get
reasonable results here.
