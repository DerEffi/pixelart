This sample program demonstrates how to use a HD44780-controlled LCD dot-matrix
display connected using an I2C module. Before building you have to configure the
program in kernel.cpp according to the hardware of your LCD display. You have to
set the display size (columns, rows) and the I2C address of the interace module.

There are two modes of the demo program. If you start it without an USB keyboard
connected, it will display "No keyboard!" on the LCD display and will count the
time from program start on.

With an USB keyboard connected you can type on it and the typed characters will
be echoed to the LCD display. You may have to set-up your keyboard map first,
using the "keymap=" setting in cmdline.txt (see doc/cmdline.txt) to get
reasonable results here.
