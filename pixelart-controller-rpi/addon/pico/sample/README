README

This sample loads and starts a program into the Raspberry Pi Pico, which has to
be connected as follows (SoC numbers):

Raspberry Pi	Raspberry Pi
Pico		1-4 or Zero

SWCLK	<---	GPIO17
SWDIO	<--->	GPIO27
RUN	<---	GPIO24
GND	<--->	GND

This is the default setting. If you want to different GPIO pins, you have to
update the configuration in the file kernel.cpp.

The program loads the file firmware.bin to the Raspberry Pi Pico, which does
simply blink the LED. If you want to load your own program, you have to replace
this file. Be sure to copy the .bin file from the built Pico SDK project and
rename it to firmware.bin in this directory. Your Pico project must be
configured for operation from RAM using this option in CMakeLists.txt, where
PROJECT is the project name:

pico_set_binary_type (PROJECT no_flash)

You should install the file dummy_flash.uf2 in the flash of your Raspberry Pi
Pico before running the program.
