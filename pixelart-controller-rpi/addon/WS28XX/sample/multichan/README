README

This sample allows to control multiple LED stripes (aka NeoPixels) simultaneous,
which are equipped with the WS2812. It uses the SMI (Second Memory Interface)
master of the Raspberry Pi. The LED driver can theoretically drive up to 16
lines, but the sample is prepared for three.

You may have to configure the program in the kernel.cpp file to meet your
configuration before build. The LED stripes can be connected to GPIO8 .. GPIO23
(SoC numbers, not header positions). If you have less than three stripes, the
respective GPIO pin can remain open. All LED stripes must have the same number
of LEDs, if one stripe is shorter, some LED positions will be ignored on that
stripe.

The WS2812 over SMI support (including SMI driver) was developed by Sebastien
Nicolas.
