README

This sample program realizes some light effects on a WS2801, WS2812, WS2812B or
SK6812 controlled LED stripe connected to a SPI master. You have to configure
the program in the kernel.cpp file to meet your configuration before build.

The WS28XX library and sample was initially developed by Arjan van Vught.
