README

To use this sample program you need a RTK.GPIO board allowing you to increase the number of GPIO pins.
RTK.GPIO board uses USB to serial IC Winchiphead CH340 to communicate to Raspberry Pi.
The board must be connected to an USB port of the Raspberry Pi and ready when the Raspberry Pi is started.

First blink 5 times to show the image was loaded right.
After initializing the USB driver stack the sample program drives GPIO0 - GPIO7 outputs
(can be connected to a LED), and polls the level of GPIO22 - GPIO25 inputs (can be connected to a button).
