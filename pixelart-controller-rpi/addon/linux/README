README

This directory contains some kind of Linux kernel device driver emulation code.
It is not perfect, far from complete and basically intended to make is easier to
port the Linux VCHIQ driver to Circle. This code implements the Linux kernel
interfaces used by the VCHIQ driver using Circle services.

The code in this directory has also been used for porting the accelerated
graphics userland libraries. This concerns especially a rudimentary pthreads
emulation, which has been added here, although the pthreads support is normally
not part of the Linux kernel.

Information to implement this, has been taken from the Linux kernel 4.9.59. Some
source code has been copied from Linux, other has been implemented to meet the
requirements of Circle.
