This is the sample/04-timer modified in a way that the logger output is written
to stdout of the host system, where QEMU is running on. The logger output can be
written to a file on the host system too, if the constructor of the class
CQEMUHostFile (member m_LogFile) is called with a file name given. QEMU must be
started with the -semihosting option to run this sample!

After initializing most things the timer interrupt is on and the delay loop will
be calibrated. A kernel timer is started to elapse after 15 seconds. Furthermore
a log message is generated on every second.

When the kernel timer elapses TimerHandler() is called where a "Prefetch Abort"
is generated by jumping to an invalid address (execute never bit is set in the
page table for it). Alternatively you can generate an "Undefined Instruction"
exception. This is for demonstrating the exception handler.
