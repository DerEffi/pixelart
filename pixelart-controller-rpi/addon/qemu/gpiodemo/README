README

This demo is intended to be used with QEMU and the new GPIO panel. You should
not use it on a real Raspberry Pi, because certain GPIO pins can be connected to
external circuits.

The demo continuously changes the output level of GPIO2 to GPIO12, which can be
watched on the GPIO panel. If you change the input level of GPIO13 to GPIO26 on
the panel, this will be recognised by the demo and a message will be displayed.

GPIO panel support is currently developed in QEMU. Have a look at these
repositories to get info about it:
