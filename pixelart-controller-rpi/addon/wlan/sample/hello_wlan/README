README

This sample uses the on-board WLAN device of the Raspberry Pi 3, 4 and Zero W to
connect to a WLAN and to update the system time from a NTP server. Currently
only WPA[2] enabled WLANs can be joined by default. The WLAN driver has been
ported from the Plan 9 operating system. Furthermore the ported "WPA Supplicant"
tool is used.

Before build you have to fetch to submodule addon/wlan/hostap with the following
command:

	git submodule update --init addon/wlan/hostap

Beside the main Circle libraries the libraries in addon/fatfs/ and addon/SDCard/
are needed and must be made, before the WLAN libraries and the sample can be
built with:

	cd addon/wlan
	./makeall

You have to provide the following firmware files for the different WLAN
controllers of the Raspberry Pi:

	brcmfmac43430-sdio.txt
	brcmfmac43430-sdio.bin
	brcmfmac43436-sdio.bin
	brcmfmac43436-sdio.txt
	brcmfmac43436-sdio.clm_blob
	brcmfmac43455-sdio.bin
	brcmfmac43455-sdio.clm_blob
	brcmfmac43455-sdio.txt
	brcmfmac43456-sdio.bin
	brcmfmac43456-sdio.txt
	brcmfmac43456-sdio.clm_blob

These files can be downloaded as follows (uses the "wget" tool):

	cd addon/wlan/firmware
	make

These files must be copied into the directory /firmware of the SD card, which
is used for boot. These downloaded firmware files have been tested with Circle.

Furthermore a configuration file "wpa_supplicant.conf" is required in the root
directory of the SD card. You can modify the template file in this
sample directory and set the SSID and password of your own WLAN. The alpha2
ISO/IEC code of the country, where you are in, must be set too.
